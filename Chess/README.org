* Tasks

** Move generation

Generate a list of valid moves given a chess game position and the side-to-move.

*** Basic implementation

- [ ] Moves based on piece type
- [ ] Promotion to queen
- [ ] Allow resignation 

*** Advanced implementation

- [ ] Castling (not through check)
- [ ] En-passant capture
- [ ] All promotions
- [ ] Move legality for moving in/out of check
- [ ] Draw by repetition and 50-move rule

** Search and evaluation

Create a function which will search the tree of moves from a given chess position up to a maximum depth and determine the best move 
for the computer. Use a previously written Chess player/Move generation component for enumerating the moves. 
This is where a lot of effort has been spent to improve chess-playing programs, so you can create a basic version or 
implement some of the features mentioned below to get a faster or cleverer version.

*** Basic implementation

- [ ] min-max search
- [ ] static evaluation based on material (numbers and types of pieces)

** GUI

Write a driver or main loop which will allow a user to play a game against the computer. 
This can use either a simple ASCII command-line interface or a more elaborate graphical interface.

*** Basic implementation

- [ ] Allow player to choose colour
- [ ] Validate user-entered moves
- [ ] Show updated board position after each move
- [ ] Detect and show Checkmate and Stalemate

*** Advanced implementation

- [ ] Time controls
- [ ] Detect drawn positions
- [ ] Chess engine interface: UCI, CECP or XBoard
- [ ] Use an opening book
- [ ] Show principal variation during search
- [ ] Computer thinking on opponent's time
- [ ] Save and replay games in a standard format
- [ ] Analyze positions, e.g. mate-in-N-moves
